# sinatra-todos

Your mission, and you choose to accept it, is to get a very small todo list app
pushed to Heroku.

Once you are done, submit a pull request to your cohorts copy of this
repository so that others may review your code. Spend the rest of your time
reviewing others code.

## Features

1. Guest may create TODO
2. Guest may complete TODO

Note that all visitors have access to the same TODO list. Don't worry
about that.
